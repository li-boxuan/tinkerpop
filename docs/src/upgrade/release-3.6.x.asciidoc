= TinkerPop 3.6.0

*NOT NAMED YET*

== TinkerPop 3.6.0

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.6.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-6-0[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Logging Changes

In Gremlin Server and Gremlin Console distributions, the default logging implementation of log4j 1.2.x has been
replaced by logback 1.2.x given link:https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-17571[CVE-2019-17571].
While it was easy to replace log4j for users of the zip distributions, it was a little harder for our packaged Docker
containers which should work more cleanly out of the box.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2534[TINKERPOP-2534]

==== Groovy in gremlin-driver

The `gremlin-driver` module no longer depends on `groovy` or `groovy-json`. It became an `<optional>` dependency in
3.5.0 and general deprecation of the serializers for the `JsonBuilder` class from Groovy (which was the only reason the
dependency existed in the first place) occurred in 3.5.2. As they were made `<optional>` it is likely that users who
required those packages have already adjusted their dependencies to explicitly include them. As for those who still
make use of `JsonBuilder` serialization for some reason, the only recourse is to find the code in TinkerPop and
maintain it independently. The following classes were removed as of this change (links go to their 3.5.1 versions):

=== Upgrading for Providers

==== Graph System Providers

===== Filters with Mixed Id Types

The requirement that "ids" passed to `Graph.vertices` and `Graph.edges` all be of a single type has been removed. This
requirement was a bit to prescriptive when there really wasn't a need to enforce such a validation. It even conflicted
with TinkerGraph operations where mixed `T.id` types is a feature. Graph providers may continue to support this
requirement if they wish, but it is no longer enforced by TinkerPop and the `Graph.idArgsMustBeEitherIdOrElement` has
been removed so providers will need to construct their own exception.
